## Configuration
During this lab you will configure {{SERVER_1}} **and** {{SERVER_2}} as container registries then configure the container run-time on {{SERVER_0}} to use them. Most of the remaining lab exercises will be performed on {{SERVER_0}}. These exercises represent the basics of using a container run time.

#### Exercise: Registry Configuration

##### Goals 

* Install, start and enable the registry and firewalld services.
* Open tcp firewall port 5000. 
* Use curl to test connectivity to the registry services.

##### Howto

Perform the following on both {{SERVER_1}} **and** {{SERVER_2}}.

~~~shell
# yum -y install docker-distribution firewalld
# systemctl start docker-distribution firewalld
# systemctl enable docker-distribution firewalld
# firewall-cmd --add-port 5000/tcp --permanent
# firewall-cmd --reload
~~~

Checking the Registry

~~~shell
# systemctl status docker-distribution
~~~~
Expected Output:

~~~shell

~~~

See if you can `curl` the registry. Two braces `{}` should be returned.

~~~
# curl localhost:5000/v2/
~~~

To check the firewall, `curl` the {{SERVER_1}} and {{SERVER_2}} registries from {{SERVER_0}}.

~~~
# curl {{SERVER_1}}:5000/v2/
~~~

Expected Output:

~~~shell
{}
~~~~

{% endif %}

#### Exercise: Container Run Time Configuration

##### Goals

* Configure the container run time to use the registries.

##### Howto

Perform the following on {{SERVER_0}}.

Install **wget** and your favorite text editor if you wish to use something other then **vi**.

~~~
# yum -y install wget vim nano
~~~

Edit the `/etc/containers/registries.conf` file to include your two registries.

~~~shell
[registries.insecure]
registries = ['{{SERVER_1}}:5000','{{SERVER_2}}:5000']
~~~~

Make sure you can restart the container run time service with no errors before proceeding.

~~~shell
# systemctl restart docker
~~~

#### Exercise: Tagging and pushing images to a remote registry

##### Goals
* Loading an image from an archive. 
* Tag and push an image to a remote registry.

##### Howto

Load the *mystery* image from the content server {{SERVER_DIST}}.

~~~
# wget -O - http://{{SERVER_DIST}}/content/images/mystery.tar | docker load
~~~

Verify the image loaded.

~~~shell
# docker images
~~~

Expected Output:

~~~shell
REPOSITORY                           TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
mystery                              latest              c82b952c1204        10 months ago       123.4 MB
~~~

Now tag and push the *mystery* image to the remote registry hosted at {{SERVER_1}}.

~~~
# docker tag mystery {{SERVER_1}}:5000/mystery
~~~

Confirm the tag is correct.

~~~
# docker images
~~~

Expected Output:

~~~
REPOSITORY                           TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
mystery                              latest              c82b952c1204        10 months ago       123.4 MB
rhserver1.example.com:5000/mystery   latest              c82b952c1204        10 months ago       123.4 MB
~~~

Finally, push the image to the {{SERVER_1}} registry.

~~~
# docker push {{SERVER_1}}:5000/mystery
~~~

Expected Output:

~~~
The push refers to a repository [rhserver2.example.com:5000/mystery]
86bac94d71f4: Pushed 
5d6cbe0dbcf9: Pushed 
latest: digest: sha256:e6f59879436cf2272c1ca14e69e09cb029d13592e38c3d95eee7162d8ef08560 size: 736

#### Exercise: Pulling images from a remote registry

##### Goals

* Saving and removing images from the container run-time.
* Pulling an image from a remote registry.

##### Howto

If the push was successful, make a backup copy of the mystery image, delete the local cached images and pull a new image from the remote registry on {{SERVER_1}}. 

~~~
# docker save mystery > backup.tar
# docker rmi mystery {{SERVER_1}}:5000/mystery
# docker pull {{SERVER_1}}:5000/mystery
~~~

Expected Output:

~~~
Using default tag: latest
