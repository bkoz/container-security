## Introduction

This lab session is a low-level, hands-on introduction to container security using Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7. It can be delivered by an instructor or consumed as a series of self paced exercises.

### Prerequisites

* Fundamental Red Hat Enterprise Linux user and administrator concepts. 
* Basic text editing skills using vim or nano.
* An introductory knowledge of Docker is helpful.

#### Lab Environment

![Lab Diagram]({% image_path con-sec-lab.png %})

You will be working with the following systems running Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) version 7.5. 

* {{SERVER_0}} (Container Host)
* {{SERVER_1}} (Container Registry)
* {{SERVER_2}} (Container Registry)
* {{SERVER_DIST}} (Bastion host and content server)
  * Repos
    * rhel-7-server-rpms 
    * rhel-7-server-optional-rpms 
    * rhel-7-server-extras-rpms 
    * rhel-7-server-supplementary-rpms
  * Content (container images, scanner example code) 

{{SERVER_0}}, {{SERVER_1}} and {{SERVER_2}} can only be accessed from a bastion host which is publicly accessible via ssh.

##### DIY Lab Environment

You can easily build out this lab yourself. Just get a hold of (3) RHEL7.5 servers that are subscribed to the repos listed above. Contact bkozdemb@redhat.com for the image content (I can't host it to the general public ). The bastion host is optional.

If you are internal to Red Hat, this lab is available as a [Ravello](https://cloud.ravellosystems.com/) blueprint (SUMMIT-L1007-bp).

#### Exercise

To get started, make sure you can connect to the bastion host and
the servers listed above.

1) Right click on the desktop to open a terminal window.

2) Substitute the global user id (**GUID**) you obtained from the registration page to login to the bastion host.

~~~shell
$ ssh {{BASTION}}
~~~

3) From the bastion host, switch to the **cloud-user** user.

~~~shell
$ sudo -iu cloud-user
~~~

4) As the **cloud-user**, login to the servers as {{ROOT_USERNAME}}@{{SERVER_0}}

~~~shell
$ ssh {{ROOT_USERNAME}}@{{SERVER_0}}
~~~
