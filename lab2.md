![Lab Diagram]({% image_path con-sec-lab.png %})

You will be working with the following systems running Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) version 7.5. 

* {{SERVER_0}} (Container Host)
* {{SERVER_1}} (Container Registry)
* {{SERVER_2}} (Container Registry)
* {{SERVER_DIST}} (Bastion host and content server)
  * rhel-7-server-rpms 
  * rhel-7-server-optional-rpms 
  * rhel-7-server-extras-rpms 
  * rhel-7-server-supplementary-rpms 


These servers can only be accessed from a bastion host which is publicly accessible via ssh.

#### Exercise

To get started, make sure you can connect to the bastion host and
the servers listed above.

1) Right click on the desktop to open a terminal window.

2) Substitute the global user id (GUID) you obtained from the registration page to login to the bastion host.

~~~shell
$ ssh {{BASTION}}
~~~

3) From the bastion host, switch to the **cloud-user** user.

~~~shell
$ sudo -iu cloud-user
~~~

4) As the **cloud-user**, login to the servers as {{ROOT_USERNAME}}@{{SERVER_0}}

~~~shell
$ ssh {{ROOT_USERNAME}}@{{SERVER_0}}
~~~
